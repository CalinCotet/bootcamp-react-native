# BOOKS APP

The project's purpose was to learn and create a react native app during the React-Native Bootcamp.
So for this training, the app was developed to only run on iOS. There are a few configs to make so it can run on Android too.

To run this app, clone the project and run

>npm install

Go to the ios folder and run

> cd ios

> pod install

Go back to the main folder and run

> npx react-native start

This will start a js bundler, like Metro. After that, run

> npx react-native run-ios

This will launch an iOS simulator and build the app. 

Thanks! :D
